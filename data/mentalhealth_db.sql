INSERT INTO `disorders` VALUES (1,'Depression','Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called a major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life is not worth living. More than just a bout of the blues, depression is not a weakness and you can not simply \"snap out\" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But do not get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy, or both.'),(2,'Schizophrenia','Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.'),(3,'Bipolar','Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.'),(4,'Post-traumatic stress','Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that is triggered by a terrifying event â€” either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.'),(5,'Autism Spectrum','Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of learning, moving, or paying attention. It is important to note that some people without ASD might also have some of these symptoms. But for people with ASD, these characteristics can make life very challenging.'),(6,'Borderline Personality','A Borderline personality disorder is a mental health disorder that impacts the way you think and feels about yourself and others, causing problems functioning in everyday life. It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships. With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness, and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships.'),(7,'Obsessive-Compulsive','Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress. You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior â€” the vicious cycle of OCD.'),(8,'Asperger Syndrome','Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger, is a former neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis in itself, having been merged with other disorders into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were merged into ASD by relatively unimpaired language and intelligence.'),(9,'Anxiety','Anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger, and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood.'),(10,'Dissociative Identity','Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental health condition. People with DID have two or more separate identities. These personalities control their behavior at different times. Each identity has its own personal history, traits, likes and dislikes. DID can lead to gaps in memory and hallucinations (believing something is real when it isnâ€™t).Dissociative identity disorder used to be called multiple personality disorder or split personality disorder.');

An individual experiencing sadness may become quiet or lethargic, and withdraw themselves from others. An example of severe sadness is depression, a mood that can be brought on by major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder. Crying can be an indication of sadness.'),(2,'Irritability','Irritability is the ability that living organisms have to respond to changes in their environment. The term is used for both the physiological reaction to stimuli and for the pathological, abnormal, or excessive sensitivity to stimuli. Irritability can be demonstrated in behavioral responses to both physiological and behavioral stimuli, including environmental, situational, sociological, and emotional stimuli.'),(3,'Loss of Interest','Loss of feeling of pleasure in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.'),(4,'Sleep Disturbances',NULL),(5,'Physical Problems',NULL),(6,'Delusions','A delusion is a false fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or some other misleading effects of perception, as individuals with those beliefs are able to change or readjust their beliefs upon reviewing the evidence.'),(7,'Hallucinations','A hallucination is a perception in the absence of an external stimulus that has the qualities of a real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, and substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space.Hallucination is a combination of 2 conscious states of brain wakefulness and REM sleep.'),(8,'Disorganized Thinking',NULL),(9,'Abnormal Behavior.','Abnormal behavior is behavior that is out of the ordinary and is not necessarily indicative of a mental or psychological disorder.'),(10,'Negative Symptoms','Negative Symptoms is an individual inability to perform basic, normal functions of living in society, such as logical thinking, self-care, social interaction, and planning..'),(11,'Unstable Feelings',NULL),(12,'Contradictory Behavior','Contradictory Behavior is behavior that goes against each other.'),(13,'Disturbing Thoughts',NULL),(14,'Physical Distress',NULL),(15,'Freeze Response','Freeze Response (also called hyperarousal or the acute stress response) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival.'),(16,'Repetitive Behavior',NULL),(17,'Difficulties in Social Interaction',NULL),(18,'Impulsivity','Impulsivity (or impulsiveness) is a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of the consequences.'),(19,'Unstable Relationships',NULL),(20,'Fear of Abandonment',NULL),(21,'Panic or Doom','Panic is a sudden sensation of fear, which is so strong as to dominate or prevent reason and logical thinking, replacing it with overwhelming feelings of anxiety and frantic agitation consistent with an animalistic fight-or-flight reaction.'),(22,'Tired',NULL),(23,'Memory Problem',NULL);
